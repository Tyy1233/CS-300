The problems I ran into with the code were how to access the partitcular word document. I found the the program needed to read the information of the classes through a .txt format and struggle to write the code in a manner that would accomplish this. I approached this problem by understanding first how to access the file, read and edit the file. This is important to set up the data structures so that they can be read correctly by the system. I over came many road blocks with  research and trial and error. This exapanded my under standing for programing in C++ because there are so many ways to approach problems that is makes it so that I can find better ways to look at problems. The program I wrote was fairly simplistic and is able to be used with the same file over and over again. Want to add a class? Simply add it to the list in the same format and the program with continue to work properly. The program is fairly easy to follow and can accomplish the same goal.
